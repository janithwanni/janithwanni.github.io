# Enough
Oh weary traveller
Take rest
Under my shade
I have seen many wander
Looking for rest
Their hearts’ bleeding
When asked why
They simply shrug
“I opened it out 
To show what’s inside”
To which I asked
“Did they like it”
Darkened faces 
Looked down at their feet
A simple no 
Would suffice
But they never 
Said that word
To anyone who asked
With a heavy sigh
They stitch and stitch
Their wounded hearts
Back to the way it was
Softly beating
With a dash of hope
“You are enough”
I whisper to them
“What matters
Is how much you give
And how well you give it
Not what they take
Nor what they say
Nor what they think”
They look up 
Hope bringing back life
To hearts that were dead
“In the end
We shall leave behind
Memories
And acts of good will
The rest 
Is up to them to decide “ 
Their eyes close 
Their heads lean back
A peaceful ending
Is all they deserve
A withered old tree i am
Giving shade 
To the kind souls
That shall make this world
A better place to live in
