I’m a clown  
Not one with makeup  
But with a simple mask  
Simple fragile wood  
Is all there is  
A better mask  
Should be there  
To hold the darkness  
Seeping from me  

Hearing two voices  
One from my mouth  
One from my head  
The mask is for the latter  
Hiding the scars  
And the poison  
From the rest of the world

The former needs no guard  
Only a mind open to satire  
The humor is aplenty  
For all stages of life  
From birth  
To creating life  
Behind locked doors  
To sleeping  
In a locked box

Once in a while  
The wooden mask breaks  
Shattering to pieces  
Those who witness it  
Shall stare in awe  
At teary eyes  
At the scars  
And the lips struggling to smile  
For the mask was there  
Not to protect the voice within  
But to protect the world from it  

And from thereon  
The witnesses  
Always treasured the smile  
Checking up everyday  
On the face behind the mask   
To sooth the wounds  
And to create a smile

But I’m a clown  
And my job is simple  
To create happiness  
And to give a smile  
But never will I  
Put my burden  
On another soul  
And from thereon  
I put another mask   
Underneath my wooden mask

A thin one  
Made out of lies  
Lies not to deceive   
But to warm the heart  
That everything is all right  
There’s no need to worry  
For I’m a clown  
And I’ll be all right
