# Balance

The candle never thought  
Standing there   
shorter and shorter   
Day by day  
That he was not providing warmth  
When the fireplace was already burning bright  
Perhaps the best   
the candle could have given   
Or maybe asked for was  
A gentle breeze to take its flame away  
Perhaps what the world needed  
Was not a bit more warmth  
But rather a dash of coldness   
To make the living place  
A heaven to reside in
