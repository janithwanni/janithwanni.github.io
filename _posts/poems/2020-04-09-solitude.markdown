# Solitude 
You feared it
Despised it
Loathed it
You ran away
Drowned your pain
In puddles of laughter
But never did the puddle
Grow into a lake
You flew away
From puddle to puddle
Wishing for a lake
Only to fall
With wings too tired
All that was left
Was solitude
All avenues closed
No where to flee
But once inside
The missing piece
Was clear
An ear for a voice
Both from inside
Puddles of laughter
May never come
But a small fountain
Shall at least
Pour the water
To bring life
From death
