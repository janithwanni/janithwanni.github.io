# Run away

She entered the room
His heart leaped forward
To break free
From the cage 
Built over forgotten tears
His brain went cold
Not with sorrow
But with anger
And his feet
Took him away
Away from the room
Away from the misery averted
Into the loneliness 
Where memories burned 
In an undying hearth
Memories of old times past
When her presence 
Sparked his entire soul
And brought out
All that is good inside him
