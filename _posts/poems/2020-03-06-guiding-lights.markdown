Look up above you

And see the stars twinkling 

Every step you take

They will be by your side

Each little star is an angel

A tiny little flame

Struggling to burn bright

Yet the angels 

Will burn with all their might 

To shine their light on to you

The beauty of angels 

Lies in their path along side us

Angels will guide you

Keep you safe

And provide you warmth

And when you reach 

The one place 

that you always wanted to be at

Then the angelâ€™s time is up

With a satisfying sigh

The tiny little flame

Will no longer struggle to burn bright

Angels come in to our lives

To bring us to a good place

After the deed is done

Then the angel shall take their leav
