## A

An aspiring arsonist

Actively availing an ailment 

Avoiding an atypical life

Angered by the aristocracy

And the altruistic 

Avenging the alienated

To avert an apocalypse

Ascending to an astral area

Anonymity was not amiss

Yet the anomaly was apparent

His attempt was in accord

To get the accolade 

Of the angels above him

All angles were approached

And in the end

An apparition was all there was

An abyss staring back at him

## B
## C
## D
## E
## F

A Fickle frail fragile mind

A facade for a few

a facet of truth for the favored 

Flooded with fear of falling

Into a fog of faint feelings

Fixations into the far

Bringing frustrations

Drawing fractals in a flow 

Of formidable fortitude

Throwing the fidgeting mind

Out of focus

Finishing it in furious flames
