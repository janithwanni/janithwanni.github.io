# Dreams

The tide rises  
Slowly seeping in  
No dams  
No fortifications   
No boulders  
Could stop it  
The walls crumbled  
As the castle  
Slowly dissolved  
Into a pile of sand  
The king was inside  
Trapped in his bed  
He could run  
But he knew not  
Where the water  
Would rise next  
The king had a choice  
To fight or flee  
And he chose to flee  
But not through  
The gates of his castle  
But through sleep  
He voyaged   
He conquered  
He fell in love  
For once he was happy  
Everything happened for the best  
He was the creator  
And the actor  
Of his own dreams  
While he calmly slept  
And let the tide  
Wash him away
