# Poison

“Mine! All mine!”  
Screams and roars  
Lost in the air  
The protector watched  
As the protected  
Mingled with the forbidden  
Poison began to swell  
Anger burnt within   
“How dare you!  
You were all mine!”  
Anger became shock  
Shock became acceptance  
Defeat was inevitable  
For not even the strongest trees  
Could hold the wind   
In its leaves
