## Random Variables

Random Variables are probably the most fundamental pieces of probability and statistics. Before we start on what a random variable is let us first discuss what is a sample space and event space. Even though we defined them early on we didnt quite get to discuss them through an example. 

Let us take the most simplest example. We are going to toss two coins. Now if we denote the sample space by $$\Omega$$ then $$\Omega = \{TT,TH,HT,HH\} $$ The event space would consist of all possible events ranging from $$\{\}$$ to $$\{TT,TH,HT,HH\}$$ with $$2^4$$ number of elements. 

The notion of a random variable is _to be filled_
